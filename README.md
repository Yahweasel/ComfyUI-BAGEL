</p>

BAGEL is an open-source multimodal foundation model with 7B active parameters (14B total) that adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts (MoT) architecture. It is designed for multimodal understanding and generation tasks, outperforming top-tier open-source VLMs like Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL-2.5 on standard multimodal understanding leaderboards, and delivering text-to-image quality competitive with specialist generators such as SD3.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate high-quality images using natural language prompts
- **Image Editing**: Edit existing images based on textual descriptions  
- **Image Understanding**: Perform Q&A and analysis on images
- **Reasoning Process Display**: Optionally display the model's reasoning process

## Installation

### 1. Download Model
The BAGEL-7B-MoT model will be automatically downloaded to `models/bagel/BAGEL-7B-MoT/` when first used. You can also manually download it:
```bash
# Clone model using git lfs (recommended)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT models/bagel/BAGEL-7B-MoT

# Or use huggingface_hub
pip install huggingface_hub
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download(repo_id='ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT', local_dir='models/bagel/BAGEL-7B-MoT')"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Restart ComfyUI
Restart ComfyUI to load the new nodes.

## FAQ

### 1. VRAM Requirements
The official recommendation for generating a 1024Ã—1024 image is over 80GB GPU memory. However, multi-GPU setups can distribute the memory load. For example:
- **Single GPU**: A100 (40GB) takes approximately 340-380 seconds per image.
- **Multi-GPU**: 3 RTX3090 GPUs (24GB each) complete the task in about 1 minute.
- **Compressed Model**: Using the DFloat11 version requires only 22GB VRAM and can run on a single 24GB GPU, with peak memory usage around 21.76GB (A100) and generation time of approximately 58 seconds.

### 2. Quantized Version
A quantized version of BAGEL is currently under development, which aims to reduce VRAM requirements further.

### 3. NameError: 'Qwen2Config' is not defined
This issue is likely related to environment or dependency problems. For more information, refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/neverbiasu/ComfyUI-BAGEL/issues/7).
